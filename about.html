<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a kind and detail-oriented web developer with a deep passion for building clean, functional,
   and user-friendly websites. I believe great web development isn’t just about writing code—it
   ’s about creating meaningful digital experiences 
  that help people and solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>I approach every project with care, patience, and a commitment to doing things the right way. Whether I'm
   working on the front-end, back-end, or diving into responsive design, I 
  enjoy the process of turning ideas into well-structured, visually appealing websites.</p>

<p>Kindness and thoughtfulness guide not only how I interact with clients and col
  laborators, but also how I code—intentionally,
   respectfully, and always with the user in mind.</p>

   <p>I’m not just here to build websites. I’m here to build trust, reliability, and results.</p>
